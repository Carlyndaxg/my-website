        <span id="largestsize"><p id="largefont" style="color:white;"> About Me </p></span>
        <p id="roundbold" style="color:white;"> Hello! </p>
        <span id="smallsize"><p id="roundregular" style="color:white;"> I'm Carlynda Gao, an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley originially from San Jose, California. I enjoy going on runs and hikes, snowboarding, swimming, reading, writing, cooking and baking, taking photos, drawing, listening to music, and spending time with my friends, family, and my cat Harry! I also love going to the beach, exploring nature, and traveling. I especially love going to Lake Tahoe in both the winter and summer, visiting my sister in New York, and visiting my extended family in China. </p>
        <p id="roundregular" style="color:white;"> In high school I was involved in research, competitive clubs such as DECA and Mock Trial, a part-time job at a boba shop, and volunteering at various non-profit organizations such as environmental restoration groups and animal shelters. Fun fact: I adopted my cat Harry from one of the animal shelters I volunteered at. </p>
        <p id="roundregular" style="color:white;"> As a student at UC Berkeley, I am studying computer science, (pure) mathematics, and political economy. I'm involved in research in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, the Chinese Student Association, and the Berkeley Chinese Alumni International Association. I'm interested in art & design, economics from a historical perspective, the intersection of computer science and mathematics, and pure mathematics<code>&#8212;</code><code>&#8212;</code>especially complex and differential geometry, topology, and abstract linear algebra. I love a good challenge and I enjoy problem solving, especially when it comes to logic problems, puzzles, and game theory. I hope to explore a career in software engineering, web development, and quantitative trading, research, or development. </p></span>
