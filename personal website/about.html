            <span id="roundbold" style="color:white;"> Hello! </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span id="smallsize"><span id="roundregular" style="color:white;"> I'm Carlynda Gao, an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley originally from San Jose, California. I enjoy going on runs and hikes, snowboarding, swimming, reading, writing, cooking and baking, taking photos, drawing, listening to music, and spending time with my friends, family, and my cat Harry! I also love going to the beach, exploring nature, traveling, and being around natural bodies of water. I love going to Lake Tahoe in the winter and summer, visiting my sister in New York, and visiting my extended family in China when possible. </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span id="roundregular" style="color:white;"> In high school I was involved in research, competitive clubs such as DECA and Mock Trial, a part-time job at a boba shop, and volunteering at various non-profit organizations such as environmental restoration groups and animal shelters. Fun fact: I adopted my cat Harry from one of the animal shelters I volunteered at. </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span id="roundregular" style="color:white;"> As a student at UC Berkeley, I am studying computer science, (pure) mathematics, and political economy. I'm involved in research in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, the Chinese Student Association, and the Berkeley Chinese Alumni International Association. Educationally I'm interested in art & design, marine biology, economics from a historical perspective, the intersection of computer science and mathematics, the intersection of physics and mathematics, and pure mathematical topics such as complex and differential geometry, topology, abstract linear algebra, and other concepts that involve visualization. I love a good challenge and I enjoy problem solving, especially when it comes to logic problems, puzzles, and game theory. I also love building things and I value continual learning, so I hope to explore a career in software engineering, web development, and quantitative trading, research, or development. </span></span>
